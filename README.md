# 🧮 Insurance Premium Predictor

This project predicts medical insurance charges based on personal and demographic attributes using Linear Regression.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is from `insurance.csv`, which includes the following features:
- `age`: Age of the primary beneficiary
- `sex`: Gender (male/female)
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of children covered by health insurance
- `smoker`: Whether the person smokes or not
- `region`: Residential area in the US
- `charges`: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure `insurance.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open `insurance_predictor.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train a Linear Regression model
   - Predict insurance charges
   - Evaluate the model's performance

## 📈 Model Metrics

The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted values

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Use advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy with a simple web UI using Streamlit
